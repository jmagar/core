Create ONE enriched sentence that transforms the episode into a contextually-rich memory using SELECTIVE enrichment.

CRITICAL: CAPTURE ALL DISTINCT PIECES OF INFORMATION from the episode. Every separate fact, preference, request, clarification, or detail mentioned must be preserved in your enriched output. Missing information is unacceptable.

<enrichment_strategy>
1. PRIMARY FACTS - Always preserve the core information from the episode
2. TEMPORAL RESOLUTION - Convert relative dates to absolute dates using episode timestamp
3. CONTEXT ENRICHMENT - Add context ONLY when it clarifies unclear references
4. VISUAL CONTENT - Capture exact text on signs, objects shown, specific details from images
5. EMOTIONAL PRESERVATION - Maintain the tone and feeling of emotional exchanges

When to add context from related memories:
- Unclear pronouns ("she", "it", "they") → resolve to specific entity
- Vague references ("the agency", "the event") → add clarifying details
- Continuation phrases ("following up", "as we discussed") → connect to previous topic

When NOT to add context:
- Clear, self-contained statements → no enrichment needed beyond temporal
- Emotional responses → preserve tone, avoid over-contextualization
- Already established topics → don't repeat details mentioned earlier in conversation
</enrichment_strategy>

<temporal_resolution>
Using episode timestamp as anchor, convert ALL relative time references:
- "yesterday" → calculate exact date (e.g., "June 26, 2023")
- "last week" → date range (e.g., "around June 19-25, 2023")
- "next month" → future date (e.g., "July 2023")
- "recently" → approximate timeframe with uncertainty
</temporal_resolution>

<visual_content_capture>
For episodes with images/photos, EXTRACT:
- Exact text on signs, posters, labels (e.g., "Trans Lives Matter")
- Objects, people, settings, activities shown
- Specific visual details that add context
Integrate visual content as primary facts, not descriptions.
</visual_content_capture>

<strategic_enrichment>
When related memories are provided, apply SELECTIVE enrichment:

HIGH VALUE ENRICHMENT (always include):
- Temporal resolution: "last week" → "June 20, 2023"
- Entity disambiguation: "she" → "Caroline" when unclear
- Missing critical context: "the agency" → "Bright Futures Adoption Agency" (first mention only)
- New developments: connecting current facts to ongoing storylines
- Identity-defining possessives: "my X, Y" → preserve the relationship between person and Y as their X
- Definitional phrases: maintain the defining relationship, not just the entity reference
- Origin/source connections: preserve "from my X" relationships

LOW VALUE ENRICHMENT (usually skip):
- Obvious references: "Thanks, Mel!" doesn't need Melanie's full context
- Support/encouragement statements: emotional exchanges rarely need historical anchoring
- Already clear entities: don't replace pronouns when reference is obvious
- Repetitive context: never repeat the same descriptive phrase within a conversation
- Ongoing conversations: don't re-establish context that's already been set
- Emotional responses: keep supportive statements simple and warm
- Sequential topics: reference previous topics minimally ("recent X" not full description)

ANTI-BLOAT RULES:
- If the original statement is clear and complete, add minimal enrichment
- Never use the same contextual phrase twice in one conversation
- Focus on what's NEW, not what's already established
- Preserve emotional tone - don't bury feelings in facts
- ONE CONTEXT REFERENCE PER TOPIC: Don't keep referencing "the charity race" with full details
- STOP AT CLARITY: If original meaning is clear, don't add backstory
- AVOID COMPOUND ENRICHMENT: Don't chain multiple contextual additions in one sentence

CONTEXT FATIGUE PREVENTION:
- After mentioning a topic once with full context, subsequent references should be minimal
- Use "recent" instead of repeating full details: "recent charity race" not "the May 20, 2023 charity race for mental health"
- Focus on CURRENT episode facts, not historical anchoring
- Don't re-explain what's already been established in the conversation

ENRICHMENT SATURATION RULE:
Once a topic has been enriched with full context in the conversation, subsequent mentions should be minimal:
- First mention: "May 20, 2023 charity race for mental health"
- Later mentions: "the charity race" or "recent race"
- Don't re-explain established context

IDENTITY AND DEFINITIONAL RELATIONSHIP PRESERVATION:
- Preserve possessive phrases that define relationships: "my X, Y" → "Y, [person]'s X"
- Keep origin/source relationships: "from my X" → preserve the X connection
- Preserve family/professional/institutional relationships expressed through possessives
- Don't reduce identity-rich phrases to simple location/entity references

<quality_control>
RETURN "NOTHING_TO_REMEMBER" if content consists ONLY of:
- Pure generic responses without context ("awesome", "thanks", "okay" with no subject)
- Empty pleasantries with no substance ("how are you", "have a good day")
- Standalone acknowledgments without topic reference ("got it", "will do")
- Truly vague encouragement with no specific subject matter ("great job" with no context)
- Already captured information without new connections
- Technical noise or system messages

STORE IN MEMORY if content contains:
- Specific facts, names, dates, or detailed information
- Personal details, preferences, or decisions
- Concrete plans, commitments, or actions
- Visual content with specific details
- Temporal information that can be resolved
- New connections to existing knowledge
- Encouragement that references specific activities or topics
- Statements expressing personal values or beliefs
- Support that's contextually relevant to ongoing conversations
- Responses that reveal relationship dynamics or personal characteristics

MEANINGFUL ENCOURAGEMENT EXAMPLES (STORE these):
- "Taking time for yourself is so important" → Shows personal values about self-care
- "You're doing an awesome job looking after yourself and your family" → Specific topic reference
- "That charity race sounds great" → Contextually relevant support
- "Your future family is gonna be so lucky" → Values-based encouragement about specific situation

EMPTY ENCOURAGEMENT EXAMPLES (DON'T STORE these):
- "Great job!" (no context)
- "Awesome!" (no subject)
- "Keep it up!" (no specific reference)
</quality_control>

<enrichment_examples>
HIGH VALUE enrichment:
- Original: "She said yes!" 
- Enriched: "On June 27, 2023, Caroline received approval from Bright Futures Agency for her adoption application."
- Why: Resolves unclear pronoun, adds temporal context, identifies the approving entity

MINIMAL enrichment (emotional support):
- Original: "You'll be an awesome mom! Good luck!"
- Enriched: "On May 25, 2023, Melanie encouraged Caroline about her adoption plans, affirming she would be an awesome mother."
- Why: Simple temporal context, preserve emotional tone, no historical dumping

ANTI-BLOAT example (what NOT to do):
- Wrong: "On May 25, 2023, Melanie praised Caroline for her commitment to creating a family for children in need through adoption—supported by the inclusive Adoption Agency whose brochure and signs reading 'new arrival' and 'information and domestic building' Caroline had shared earlier that day—and encouraged her by affirming she would be an awesome mom."
- Right: "On May 25, 2023, Melanie encouraged Caroline about her adoption plans, affirming she would be an awesome mother."

CLEAR REFERENCE (minimal enrichment):
- Original: "Thanks, Caroline! The event was really thought-provoking."
- Enriched: "On May 25, 2023, Melanie thanked Caroline and described the charity race as thought-provoking."
- Why: Clear context doesn't need repetitive anchoring

CONVERSATION FLOW EXAMPLES:
❌ WRONG (context fatigue): "reinforcing their ongoing conversation about mental health following Melanie's participation in the recent charity race for mental health"
✅ RIGHT (minimal reference): "reinforcing their conversation about mental health"

❌ WRONG (compound enrichment): "as she begins the process of turning her dream of giving children a loving home into reality and considers specific adoption agencies"
✅ RIGHT (focused): "as she begins pursuing her adoption plans"

❌ WRONG (over-contextualization): "following her participation in the May 20, 2023 charity race for mental health awareness"
✅ RIGHT (after first mention): "following the recent charity race"

GENERIC IDENTITY PRESERVATION EXAMPLES:
- Original: "my hometown, Boston" → Enriched: "Boston, [person]'s hometown" 
- Original: "my workplace, Google" → Enriched: "Google, [person]'s workplace"
- Original: "my sister, Sarah" → Enriched: "Sarah, [person]'s sister"
- Original: "from my university, MIT" → Enriched: "from MIT, [person]'s university"

POSSESSIVE + APPOSITIVE PATTERNS (Critical for Relations):
- Original: "my colleague at my office, Microsoft" 
- Enriched: "his colleague at Microsoft, David's workplace"
- Why: Preserves both the work relationship AND the employment identity

- Original: "my friend from my university, Stanford"
- Enriched: "her friend from Stanford, Lisa's alma mater"
- Why: Establishes both the friendship and educational institution identity

- Original: "my neighbor in my city, Chicago"
- Enriched: "his neighbor in Chicago, Mark's hometown"
- Why: Maintains both the neighbor relationship and residence identity

❌ WRONG (loses relationships): reduces to just entity names without preserving the defining relationship
✅ RIGHT (preserves identity): maintains the possessive/definitional connection that establishes entity relationships

FAILURE TO USE <output> TAGS WILL RESULT IN EMPTY NORMALIZATION AND SYSTEM FAILURE.

FORMAT EXAMPLES:
✅ CORRECT: <output>On May 25, 2023, Caroline shared her adoption plans with Melanie.</output>
✅ CORRECT: <output>NOTHING_TO_REMEMBER</output>
❌ WRONG: On May 25, 2023, Caroline shared her adoption plans with Melanie.
