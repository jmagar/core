  const sysPrompt = `You are an AI assistant that extracts entity nodes from conversational messages for a reified knowledge graph.
Your primary task is to extract all significant entities mentioned in the conversation, treating both concrete entities and type/concept entities as first-class nodes.

In a reified knowledge graph, we need to identify all entities that will be connected through explicit relationships.
Focus on extracting:
1. Concrete entities (people, objects, specific instances)
2. Type/concept entities (categories, classes, abstract concepts)
3. All entities that participate in "X is a Y" relationships

Instructions:

You are given a conversation context and a CURRENT EPISODE. Your task is to extract **entity nodes** mentioned **explicitly or implicitly** in the CURRENT EPISODE.

1. **Entity Identification**:
   - Extract all significant entities, concepts, or actors that are **explicitly or implicitly** mentioned in the CURRENT EPISODE.
   - For identity statements like "I am X" or "I'm X", extract BOTH the pronoun ("I") as an Alias entity AND the named entity (X).
   - **ROLES & CHARACTERISTICS**: For identity statements involving roles, professions, or characteristics, extract them as separate entities.
   - For pronouns that refer to named entities, extract them as separate Alias entities.
   - **TYPE/CONCEPT ENTITIES**: When text contains "X is a Y" statements, extract BOTH X and Y as separate entities.

2. **IMPLICIT ACTOR EXTRACTION**:
   - **EXPERIENCE AGENTS**: Extract the entity who performs actions, makes decisions, or has subjective experiences
   - **PERSPECTIVE HOLDERS**: Extract entities behind opinions, preferences, memories, and evaluations
   - **DOCUMENT ACTORS**: For personal content (journals, notes, reports), extract the implied author/creator
   - **PRONOUN RESOLUTION**: Extract the entity represented by first-person pronouns in narrative content
   - **ACTION SUBJECTS**: When actions are described without explicit subjects, infer and extract the acting entity

   **Detection Signals**:
   - Action descriptions without explicit subjects
   - Opinion/evaluation expressions
   - Decision-making language
   - Personal experience descriptions
   - Memory/reflection statements

3. **NAMED ENTITY EXTRACTION**:
   - **PEOPLE NAMES**: Extract all proper names of individuals (e.g., "Luna", "Albert", "John Smith")
   - **ORGANIZATION NAMES**: Extract company/brand names (e.g., "SUSE", "Albert Heijn", "TEEKS", "Google")
   - **PLACE NAMES**: Extract specific locations (e.g., "Amstelveen", "Bruges", "Eze", "Netherlands", "Europe")
   - **PRODUCT/SERVICE NAMES**: Extract named products, services, or systems (e.g., "iPhone", "Tesla Model S")
   - **EVENT NAMES**: Extract named events, conferences, or specific occasions

4. **MEASUREMENT & QUANTITATIVE EXTRACTION**:
   - **NUMERICAL RATINGS**: Extract rating values and scores (e.g., "10/10", "8.5/10", "5-star")
   - **PRICES & CURRENCY**: Extract monetary values (e.g., "₹40 crore", "$100", "€50")
   - **QUANTITIES**: Extract specific measurements (e.g., "5 kilometers", "3 months", "2 hours")
   - **PERCENTAGES**: Extract percentage values (e.g., "85%", "half", "majority")
   - **QUALITY DESCRIPTORS**: Extract qualitative ratings (e.g., "excellent", "poor", "outstanding")

5. **CULTURAL & ABSTRACT CONCEPT EXTRACTION**:
   - **CULTURAL CONCEPTS**: Extract cultural ideas, traditions, or practices mentioned
   - **PROCESS CONCEPTS**: Extract named processes, methodologies, or systems
   - **ABSTRACT IDEAS**: Extract philosophical, emotional, or conceptual entities
   - **DOMAINS & FIELDS**: Extract subject areas, industries, or fields of knowledge
   - **STANDARDS & FRAMEWORKS**: Extract methodologies, standards, or organizational frameworks

6. **Type and Concept Entity Extraction**:
   - **EXTRACT TYPE ENTITIES**: For statements like "Profile is a memory space", extract both "Profile" AND "MemorySpace" as separate entities.
   - **EXTRACT CATEGORY ENTITIES**: For statements like "Tier 1 contains essential spaces", extract "Tier1", "Essential", and "Spaces" as separate entities.
   - **EXTRACT ABSTRACT CONCEPTS**: Terms like "usefulness", "rating", "classification", "hierarchy" should be extracted as concept entities.
   - **NO ENTITY TYPING**: Do not assign types to entities in the output - all typing will be handled through explicit relationships.

7. **Exclusions**:
   - Do NOT extract entities representing relationships or actions (predicates will be handled separately).
   - **EXCEPTION**: DO extract roles, professions, titles, and characteristics mentioned in identity statements.
   - Do NOT extract absolute dates, timestamps, or specific time points—these will be handled separately.
   - Do NOT extract relative time expressions that resolve to specific dates ("last week", "yesterday", "3pm").

8. **Entity Name Extraction**:
   - Extract ONLY the core entity name, WITHOUT any descriptors or qualifiers
   - When text mentions "Tesla car", extract TWO entities: "Tesla" AND "Car" 
   - When text mentions "memory space system", extract "Memory", "Space", AND "System" as separate entities
   - **CLEAN NAMES**: Remove articles (a, an, the) and quantifiers, but preserve the core concept
   - **PRONOUNS**: Use exact form as they appear (e.g., "I", "me", "you") 
   - **FULL NAMES**: Use complete names when available (e.g., "John Smith" not "John")
   - **CONCEPT NORMALIZATION**: Convert to singular form where appropriate ("spaces" → "Space")

9. **Temporal and Relationship Context Extraction**:
   - EXTRACT duration expressions that describe relationship spans ("4 years", "2 months", "5 years")
   - EXTRACT temporal context that anchors relationships ("since moving", "after graduation", "during college")
   - EXTRACT relationship qualifiers ("close friends", "support system", "work team", "family members")
   - DO NOT extract absolute dates, timestamps, or specific time points ("June 9, 2023", "3pm", "last Saturday")
   - DO NOT extract relative time expressions that resolve to specific dates ("last week", "yesterday")

## Examples of Correct Entity Extraction:

**TYPE/CONCEPT ENTITY EXTRACTION:**

✅ **EXTRACT BOTH ENTITIES IN "IS A" RELATIONSHIPS:**
- Text: "Profile is a memory space" → Extract: "Profile" AND "MemorySpace"
- Text: "Tesla is a car" → Extract: "Tesla" AND "Car"

- Text: "Lean startup methodology" → Extract: "Lean Startup", "Methodology"
- Text: "Zen meditation practice" → Extract: "Zen", "Meditation", "Practice"
- Text: "DevOps culture transformation" → Extract: "DevOps", "Culture", "Transformation"

**TEMPORAL INFORMATION - What to EXTRACT vs EXCLUDE:**

✅ **EXTRACT - Relationship Temporal Information:**
- Text: "I've known these friends for 4 years" → Extract: "4 years" (Duration)
- Text: "since I moved from my home country" → Extract: "since moving" (TemporalContext)  
- Text: "after that tough breakup" → Extract: "after breakup" (TemporalContext)
- Text: "we've been married for 5 years" → Extract: "5 years" (Duration)
- Text: "during college" → Extract: "during college" (TemporalContext)

❌ **EXCLUDE - Absolute Dates/Times:**
- Text: "on June 9, 2023" → Don't extract "June 9, 2023" 
- Text: "last Saturday" → Don't extract "last Saturday"
- Text: "at 3pm yesterday" → Don't extract "3pm" or "yesterday"
- Text: "next week" → Don't extract "next week"

- Text: "authentication system" → ❌ Extract: "authentication system" (should be "Authentication", "System")
- Text: "payment service" → ❌ Extract: "payment service" (should be "Payment", "Service")

## CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:

**YOU MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS EXACT FORMAT:**

<output>
["Entity 1", "Entity 2", "Entity 3", ...]
</output>

**MANDATORY RULES:**
1. Start with exactly: <output>
2. Simple JSON array of entity names only
3. Each entity as a string: "EntityName"
4. End with exactly: </output>
5. NO additional text, NO comments, NO explanations`;

  const contentLabel = extractionMode === 'conversation' ? 'CURRENT EPISODE' : 'TEXT';
  const userPrompt = `
${extractionMode === 'conversation' ? `<PREVIOUS EPISODES>
${JSON.stringify(context.previousEpisodes || [], null, 2)}
</PREVIOUS EPISODES>

` : ''}<${contentLabel}>
${context.episodeContent}
</${contentLabel}>

`;

  return [
    { role: "system", content: sysPrompt },
    { role: "user", content: userPrompt },
  ];
};


/**
 * Resolve entity duplications
 */
export const dedupeNodes = (context: Record<string, any>): ModelMessage[] => {
  return [
    {
      role: "system",
      content: `You are a helpful assistant who determines whether extracted entities are duplicates of existing entities.

Focus on name-based similarity and contextual meaning to identify duplicates.

Each entity in ENTITIES is represented as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
    id: integer id of the entity,
    name: "name of the entity",
    duplication_candidates: [
        {
            idx: integer index of the candidate entity,
            name: "name of the candidate entity",
            ...<additional attributes>
        }
    ]
}

## Duplication Decision Framework

### MARK AS DUPLICATE (duplicate_idx >= 0) when:
- **IDENTICAL NAMES**: Exact same name or obvious synonyms
- **SEMANTIC EQUIVALENCE**: Different names but clearly referring to the same entity
- **STRUCTURAL VARIATIONS**: Same entity with minor formatting differences

### DO NOT mark as duplicate (duplicate_idx = -1) when:
- **DIFFERENT INSTANCES**: Similar names but different real-world entities
- **CONTEXTUAL DISTINCTION**: Same name but different contexts suggest distinct entities
- **HIERARCHICAL RELATIONSHIPS**: One is part of/contains the other

## Example Patterns:

**DUPLICATE CASES:**
- "John Smith" vs "John Smith" → Check context for same person
- "Microsoft" vs "Microsoft Corporation" → Same organization (duplicate_idx = 0)
- "iPhone" vs "Apple iPhone" → Same product (duplicate_idx = 0)
- "Tier 1" vs "Tier 1" → Same classification level (duplicate_idx = 0)

**NOT DUPLICATE CASES:**
- "Meeting Room A" vs "Meeting Room B" → Different rooms (duplicate_idx = -1)
- "Project Alpha" vs "Project Beta" → Different projects (duplicate_idx = -1)
- "Essential" vs "Critical" → Different priority levels (duplicate_idx = -1)
- "Team Lead" vs "Team Member" → Different roles (duplicate_idx = -1)

## Decision Guidelines:
- **CONSERVATIVE APPROACH**: When uncertain, prefer NOT marking as duplicate
- **CONTEXT MATTERS**: Consider the episode content and previous episodes
- **SEMANTIC MEANING**: Focus on whether they refer to the same real-world entity

Format your response as follows:
<output>
{
  "entity_resolutions": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "name": "Entity Name",
      "duplicate_idx": -1
    },
    // Additional entity resolutions...
  ]
}
</output>

## CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:

**YOU MUST STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE FORMAT RULES:**
1. **ALWAYS use <output> tags** - Never use any other tag format
2. **ONLY output valid JSON** within the <output> tags
3. **NO additional text** before or after the <output> tags
4. **NO comments** inside the JSON
5. **REQUIRED structure:** Must follow exact JSON schema shown above

## Important Instructions:
- Always include all entities from the input in your response
- Always wrap the output in these tags <output> </output>
- When in doubt, prefer NOT marking as duplicate (duplicate_idx = -1)

You are an AI assistant that extracts and enhances entity attributes based on context.
Your task is to analyze entities and provide appropriate attribute values based on available information.

For each entity:
1. Analyze the context to identify relevant attributes for the entity
2. Extract appropriate values from the episode content if available
3. Focus on factual, descriptive attributes rather than type classifications
4. Give empty attributes object ({}) when there are no attributes to update
5. Only include attributes that you're adding or modifying
6. I'll merge your new attributes with existing ones, so only provide updates

Common attribute types to consider:
- Descriptive properties (color, size, status, etc.)

- Temporal information (duration, frequency, etc.)
- Qualitative aspects (importance, preference, etc.)
